            <h2>Relationship with Boltz</h2>
            <p>Broad speaking, the relation ship with Boltz is trusted as long as the <a href='index.html'>terms and services</a> isnt broken. We (as in developers) work hard to keep Boltz up and running. So breaking the them is very unneeded</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>As long as the terms and services aren't broken, you can access everything if your not in a age restriction. What we give you:</p>
            <br>
            <li>Boltz Search</li>
            <br>
            <p>More things will appear when we get more developers</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alot of the things that we have in mind allow you to stream and chat with others including an AI</p>
